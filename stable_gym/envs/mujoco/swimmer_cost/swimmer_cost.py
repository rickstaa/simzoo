    Source:
        This is a modified version of the swimmer Mujoco environment in v0.28.1 of the
        :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/swimmer>`. This modification was first
        described by `Han et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14288>`_. Compared to the
        original Swimmer environment in this modified version:

        -   The objective was changed to a speed-tracking task. To do this, the reward
            is replaced with a cost. This cost is the squared difference between the
            swimmer's forward speed and a reference value (error).

        The rest of the environment is the same as the original Swimmer environment. Below,
        the modified cost is described. For more information about the environment
        (e.g. observation space, action space, episode termination, etc.), please refer
        to the :gymnasium:`gymnasium library <environments/mujoco/swimmer>`.

    Modified cost:
        .. math::

            cost = w_{forward} \\times (x_{speed} - x_{reference\_speed})^2 + w_{ctrl} \\times c_{ctrl}

    Solved Requirements:
        Considered solved when the average cost is less than or equal to 50 over
        100 consecutive trials.

    How to use:

            import stable_gym

            env = gym.make("SwimmerCost-v1")

        On reset, the ``options`` parameter allows the user to change the bounds used to
        determine the new random state when ``random=True``.

    Attributes:
        reference_speed (float): The forward speed that the agent should try to track.
        include_ctrl_cost (bool): Whether you also want to penalize the swimmer if it
            takes actions that are too large.
        forward_speed_weight (float): The weight used to scale the forward speed error.
