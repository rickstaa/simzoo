An actuated 8-jointed Minitaur. This environment corresponds to the [MinitaurBulletEnv-v0](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/bullet/minitaur_gym_env.py) environment included in the [pybullet package](https://pybullet.org/). It is different in the fact that:

*   The objective was changed to a velocity-tracking task. To do this, the
    reward is replaced with a cost. This cost is the squared difference between
    the Minitaur's forward velocity and a reference value (error). Additionally,
    also a energy cost and health penalty can be included in the cost.
*   A minimal backward velocity bound is added to prevent the Minitaur from
    walking backwards.
*   Users are given the option to modify the Minitaur fall criteria, and thus
    the episode termination criteria.

The rest of the environment is the same as the original Minitaur environment. Please refer to the [original codebase](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/bullet/minitaur_gym_env.py) or [the article of Tan et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10332) on which the Minitaur environment is based for more information.

## Observation space

The observation space contains all eight motors' angles, velocities and torques.

## Action space

The action space contains the desired motor angles for all eight motors.

## Episode Termination

An episode is terminated when:

*   The episode is terminated if the Minitaur falls, meaning that the
    the orientation between the base and the world is greater than a threshold or
    the base is too close to the ground.
*   **Optionally**, the episode can be terminated if the Minitaur walks backwards.

## Environment goal

The Minitaur should walk forward with a certain velocity.

## Cost function

The cost function of this environment is designed in such a way that it tries to minimize the error between the Minitaur's forward velocity and a reference value. The cost function is defined as:

$$
cost = w_{forward\_velocity} \\times (x_{velocity} - x_{reference\_x\_velocity})^2 + w_{energy} \\times c_{energy} + w_{shake} \\times c_{shake} + w_{drift} \\times c_{drift} + p_{health}
$$

Where:

*   $w_{forward\_velocity}$ - is the weight of the forward velocity error.
*   $x_{velocity}$ - is the HopMintaur's forward velocity.
*   $x_{reference\_x\_velocity}$ is the reference forward velocity.
*   $w_{energy}$ is the weight of the energy cost (**optional**).
*   $c_{energy}$ is the control energy cost (**optional**).
*   $w_{shake}$ is the weight of the shake cost (**optional**).
*   $c_{shake}$ is the shake (z movement) cost (**optional**).
*   $w_{drift}$ is the weight of the drift (y movement) cost (**optional**).
*   $c_{drift}$ is the drift cost (**optional**).
*   $p_{health}$ is a penalty for being unhealthy (i.e. if the Minitaur falls over).

The energy, shake, drift, and health penalty are optional and can be disabled using the `include_energy_cost`, `include_shake_cost`, `include_drift_cost` and `include_health_penalty` environment arguments.

## How to use

This environment is part of the [Stable Gym package](https://github.com/rickstaa/stable-gym). It is therefore registered as the `stable_gym:MinitaurCost-v1` gymnasium environment when you import the Stable Gym package. If you want to use the environment in stand-alone mode, you can register it yourself.
