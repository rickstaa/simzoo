"""This package contains a modified version of the `MinitaurBullet environment`_ found in
the :pybullet:`pybullet package <>`. This environment first appeared in a paper by `Tan et al. 2018`_.
The version found here is based on the modification given by `Han et al. 2020`_. In this modified version:

-   The objective was changed to a velocity-tracking task. To do this, the reward is replaced with a cost.
    This cost is the squared difference between the Minitaur's forward velocity and a reference value (error).
-   A minimal backward velocity bound is added to prevent the Minitaur from
    walking backwards.
-   Users are given the option to modify the Minitaur fall criteria and thus
    the episode termination criteria.
