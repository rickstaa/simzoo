An actuated multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the Quad-X configuration as described by [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/connect-escs-and-motors.html) and [PX4](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/airframes/airframe_reference.html#quadrotor-x). It consists of four motors with implementations for cascaded PID controllers. This environment corresponds to the [QuadXHover-v1](https://jjshoots.github.io/PyFlyt/documentation/gym_envs/quadx_envs/quadx_hover_env.html) environment included in the [PyFlyt package](https://jjshoots.github.io/PyFlyt/index.html). It is different in the fact that:

*   The reward has been changed to a cost. This was done by negating the reward always to be positive definite.
*   A health penalty has been added. This penalty is applied when the quadrotor moves outside the flight dome or crashes. The penalty equals the maximum episode steps minus the steps taken or a user-defined penalty.
*   The `max_duration_seconds` has been removed. Instead, the `max_episode_steps` parameter of the [gym.wrappers.TimeLimit](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/misc_wrappers/#gymnasium.wrappers.TimeLimit) wrapper is used to limit the episode duration.

The rest of the environment is the same as the original QuadXHover environment. Below, the modified cost is described. For more information about the environment (e.g. observation space, action space, episode termination, etc.), please refer to the [PyFlyt package documentation](https://jjshoots.github.io/PyFlyt/index.html).

## Cost function

The cost function of this environment is designed in such a way that it tries to minimize the Euclidean distance error between the quadrotors' current position and a desired hover position (i.e. $p=x_{x,y,z}=[0,0,1]$) and the error between the quadrotors' current angular roll and pitch and their zero values. A health penalty can also be included in the cost. This health penalty is added when the drone leaves the flight dome or crashes. It equals the `max_episode_steps` minus the number of steps taken in the episode or a fixed value. The cost is computed as:

$$
cost = \| p_{drone} - p_{hover} \| + \| \theta_{roll,pitch} \| + p_{health}
$$

Where:

*   $p_{drone}$ - is the current quadrotor position (i.e. x,y,z).
*   $p_{hover}$ - is the desired hover position (i.e. x,y,z).
*   $\theta_{roll,pitch}$ - is the current quadrotor roll and pitch.
*   $p_{health}$ is a penalty for being unhealthy (i.e. if the Quadrotor moves outside the flight dome or crashes).

The health penalty is optional and can be disabled using the `include_health_penalty` environment arguments.

## Environment step return

In addition to the observations, the cost and a termination and truncation boolean, the environment also returns an info dictionary:

```python
[observation, cost, termination, truncation, info_dict]
```

Compared to the original [QuadXHover-v1](https://jjshoots.github.io/PyFlyt/documentation/gym_envs/quadx_envs/quadx_hover_env.html) environment, the following keys were added to this info dictionary:

*   **reference**: The reference that the quadrotor is tracking (i.e. the desired hover position $p=x_{x,y,z}=[0,0,1]$).
*   **state\_of\_interest**: The state that should track the reference (SOI).
*   **reference\_error**: The error between SOI and the reference.

## How to use

This environment is part of the [Stable Gym package](https://github.com/rickstaa/stable-gym). It is therefore registered as the `stable_gym:QuadXHover-v1` gymnasium environment when you import the Stable Gym package. If you want to use the environment in stand-alone mode, you can register it yourself.
