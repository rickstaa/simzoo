The :stable_gym:`Stable Gym package <>` provides a variety of environments for training and testing 
:stable_learning_control:`(stable) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms <>`.

Biological environments
-----------------------

Gym environments that are based on Biological systems.

    :maxdepth: 1

    ./biological/oscillator.rst
    ./biological/oscillator_complicated.rst

Classic control environments
----------------------------

Environments for classical control theory problems.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    ./classic_control/ex3_ekf.rst
    ./classic_control/cartpole_cost.rst

Robotics environment
--------------------

.. note::

    The robotics environments of the Stable Gym package were moved into a separate package called :ros_gazebo_gym:`Ros Gazebo Gym <>`.
